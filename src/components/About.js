        As a musician, I know the struggle of finding decent gigs, especially in
        London. Small independant artists are taken advantage of and lazy
        promoters are filling their pockets. Here we don't promote pay-for-play
        and will always put the interest of the artists first. Let's build a
        fair system together!
